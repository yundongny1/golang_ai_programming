This repository contains the code for Week 4 Assignment: Go for Statistics, for MSDS 431 Data Engineering with Go.

There are total 3 different coding languages in this respositry: R, Python, and Golang. The goal is to compare the statistical packages of 3 different languages, and see how Golang compares to more widely used coding languages such as R and Python. A Go testing file was written to ensure that the the results from Golang are correct, by cross checking with linear regression results from Python and R. We cross check the results with a 1e-6 tolerance for the float values, and all tests pass.

For R, using sys.time, we measure that it takes ~0.01 seconds to run, while Python takes 0.0411 seconds to run, and Go takes 515.2Âµs, which is 0.000515 seconds. 

Our recommendation for mangement is to use Golang, but to be aware of certain advantages and disadvantages with using Data Science for Golang. Golang is still a develping langauge, and is mostly used for cloud and backend, and the data science libraries compared to Python and R is lacking. This is understandable as R was developed for usage with statistical computing, visualiziation, and analysis. Python has been the main language in Data Sceicne communtiy for a long time, and is loved for its simplicity/ease of use, and the rich ecosystem of libraries that is used for data science is well supported. Golang's strength lies in its high performance and scalability, along with its concurrency features. While python have advantages in its offering of robust libraries, if the managers of the tech start up want software engineers and data scientitsts to work together using the same language for backend, Go would be the best choice.
